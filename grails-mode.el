;;; Usage:

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; A minor mode that adds some useful commands for navigating around
;; a grails project
;;
;; In the root of the grails project (where the grails-app directory is)
;; add this to your .dir-locals.el file (v23+)
;; (groovy-mode . ((grails-mode . 1)))
;; (java-mode . ((grails-mode . 1)))
;; (html-mode . ((grails-mode . 1)))
;;
;; This will turn on grails minor mode whenever a groovy, java or gsp file is opened,
;; this presumes you have gsp files et to use html-mode adjust to whatever mode gsp files use
;;
;; or just add this to have grails mode with any file in that directory structure
;;
;; ((nil . ((grails-mode . 1))))
;;
;; The main addition is a view in anything that shows all the grails project files

;;; Bugs:
;;  Bug tracking is currently handled using the GitHub issue tracker at
;;  https://github.com/Groovy-Emacs-Modes/groovy-emacs-modes/issues

;;; Versions:
;;  This mode is available on MELPA which tracks the mainline Git repository on GitHub, so there is a rolling release
;;  system based on commits to the mainline.

;;; Notes:

;;;  TODO:
;;   Issues with this code are managed via the project issue management
;;   on GitHub: https://github.com/Groovy-Emacs-Modes/groovy-emacs-modes/issues?state=open

;; History:
;;   History is tracked in the Git repository rather than in this file.
;;   See https://github.com/Groovy-Emacs-Modes/groovy-emacs-modes/commits/master
